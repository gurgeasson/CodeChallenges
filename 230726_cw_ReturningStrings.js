// Brief //
// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input;
// your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".
// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

// Solution //
greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;

console.log(greet("Ryan")) // expected output: "Hello, Ryan how are you doing today?"
